V1.0 Initial Version
V1.1 rom-checksums with carry
V1.2 ieee488 dataport test

I had some trouble with the 6540-ROMs in my PETs and built an special adapter to read them in my EPROM-burner.
But it's not possible to read them in my TL866, Merlin/Promenade C1 and the Tiny Eprommer :(
The 6540 need a clock to operate correctly!

I decided to code a test-kernel that verifies the 8-bit-checksums in the PET ;)
Also I appended a RAM-test for the whole 8kB.
You have to burn the image in an EPROM and plug it with an adapter in the H7-socket.
It also runs in a 2532-EPROM (upper half) in a 2316B-board in the H4-socket.

The test reads the 8-bit-checksums (without carry) from the ROMs in H1 - H6.
It verifies the checksums with the romsets 6540-011 to 6540-026.
For testing the 6540-018 or 6540-026, just plug it in the H6-socket.
The ROM-test needs no RAM to run - only the screen-memory for visibility ;)

2001TEST also checks the RAMs with 55 / AA in a continous loop.
But it's not possible to recognize the I or J chip because the test needs 2047 bytes and there is only 1 byte space left ;)
